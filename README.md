# Faasos SQL Analysis Project

## About Faasos

Faasos is an Indian food delivery company founded in 2004 and incorporated in 2011 by Jaydeep Barman and Kallol Banerjee. Originally starting as a quick-service restaurant specializing in wraps and kathi rolls, Faasos pioneered the "wraps on wheels" concept and rapidly expanded across multiple Indian cities.[1][2]

In 2014, Faasos boldly transitioned to a delivery-first model, shutting down dine-in operations and focusing exclusively on online food delivery through cloud kitchens. The company later rebranded as Rebel Foods to reflect its vision of becoming a global cloud kitchen network. Today, Rebel Foods operates multiple brands including Faasos, Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story, and Mandarin Oak, with over 300 cloud kitchens across 35+ cities in India.[2][5][1]

## Project Overview
